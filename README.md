# ChainChat: The Case Study

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site was created using the [beautiful-jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) to house the case study about a real-time, collaborative text editor that I built called [ChainChat](https://web-production-3149.up.railway.app/).

Visit the [site](https://chainchat-team.github.io/chainchat-site/) to see what it all looks like.
