# ChainChat: The Case Study

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site was created using the [beautiful-jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) to house the case study about a real-time, collaborative text editor that I built called [ChainChat](https://zoom-meets-production.up.railway.app/).


Visit the [site](www.google.com) to see what it all looks like.
